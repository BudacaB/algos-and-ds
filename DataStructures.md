## Big O asymptotic analysis (Big O notation)

- how long an algorithm takes to run
- as elements passed as input increase, how many operations do we have to do? (algorithmic efficiency)

### What is good code?
- readable
- scalable -> measured by Big O



---

## Arrays (or Lists)

- organizes items sequentially in memory
- smallest footprint
- ideal for storing data to iterate through it, especially if knowind the indexes of the stored items
- lookup - O(1)
- push - O(1)
- insert - O(n)
- delete - O(n)
